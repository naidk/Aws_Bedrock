AWS Bedrock â€“ Claude & Llama3 Examples
This repository contains Python examples showing how to run Anthropic Claude 3 (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) and Meta Llama 3 models on Amazon Bedrock, using both native model formats and the unified Converse API.

The examples demonstrate:

Claude 3 invocation using the native messages format.

Llama 3 invocation using the Converse API for cleaner prompts.

Llama 3 invocation using the native tag-based prompt format.

It also includes guidance for:

Setting up your Python environment with boto3 and AWS credentials.

Running each script individually.

Troubleshooting common Bedrock issues such as model access errors and Git push conflicts.

Best practices like using .gitignore to avoid committing secrets or unnecessary files.

These scripts are useful for anyone getting started with AWS Bedrock and wanting to experiment with LLM inference in a reproducible way.
